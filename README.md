# 🚀 Telco Customer Churn Prediction: Strategic Retention Project

## 🎯 Business Problem & Project Goal

**Problem Statement:** "Our company is experiencing a critical customer attrition issue. We are currently losing approximately **$20\%$ of our customer base annually**. Given the high cost of acquiring new customers (estimated at $5\times$ the cost of retaining an existing one), this churn rate is directly eroding our profit margins and causing a significant loss in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). The current method of offering blanket discounts to everyone is unsustainable and inefficient."

**Our Task (The Solution):** To build a robust predictive model that identifies high-risk customers, allowing the CRM team to target only the **top 10%** of potential churners with specific, cost-effective retention offers.

1.  **Identify Key Friction Points:** Determine the strongest drivers of churn. I suspect factors like contract structure, poor-performing services (e.g., Fiber Optic with no technical support), and high monthly costs are key—prove it with data.

2.  **Build a Predictive Engine:** Create a robust model that can output a **Churn Probability Score** for every active customer, identifying who is most likely to leave in the next 90 days.

3.  **Prioritize Action:** Segment these customers by risk score and provide the scoring data to our CRM team so they can target only the **top $10\%$ highest-risk, highest-value customers** with specific, cost-effective retention offers (e.g., a free month of Tech Support, a contract renewal bonus).

**Success Metric (Business Focus):** We must achieve a **Lift Score of at least 2.5 at the top 10% decile**, proving our targeted campaigns are $2.5\times$ more effective than random outreach.

* **Primary Metric (Targeting Efficiency):** We must achieve a **Lift Score of at least $2.5$ at the top $10\%$ decile**. This means the group of customers you flag as high-risk must contain $2.5$ times more actual churners than a random group.

* **Secondary Goal (Business Impact):** Your analysis must lead to actionable recommendations that can reduce the overall churn rate from $20\%$ to $18\%$ within the next year, protecting millions in ARR.

**In short: Show me who is leaving, why they are leaving, and who we should spend money on to keep.**
